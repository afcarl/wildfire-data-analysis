# wildfire-data-analysis

## Synopsis

This project is a data science design capstone for data science and engineering students at UCSD graduating in June 2017.


At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

*to fill in later, will include folder breakdown

## Motivation

The wildfire analysis application uses GIS mapping to estimate fuel build up in burnable areas surrouding San Diego. Currently the model runs off of older static records, but future improvmenets will build in a more dynamic working model which includes computer vision and common machine learning tools such as neural networks and spark.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API and Amazon References

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
